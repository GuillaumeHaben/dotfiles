Dotfiles
========

This repository contains my personal dotfiles managed with [Dotbot][dotbot]. Feel
free to use it and share it.

Install
-------

Clone this repository and run `install` to set up the dotfiles. You are live! Yes,
this is as simple as that.

Just make sure to change any personal info that you might encounter while copying
my config. For that, you can `grep -rn "TO BE CHANGED" *` from within the cloned
directory.
